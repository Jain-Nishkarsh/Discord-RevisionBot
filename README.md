# Discord-RevisionBot
A Discord bot that sends you revision questions and snippets from user specified Google Drive at times specified by the user.

This is a Discord Bot that I worked on in my 12th Grade for around 2 months on and off just because I love programming.

The Code now is *Mostly Broken* and I would love to fix it and make it an actual viable Bot in the future.

I would also like to add other features like a webpage to link your Google Drive, Set Question sending Days and Times, Frequency of sending check etc. to help use the bot easily.

I followed multiple Youtube tutorials but the one I went to the most was by ![FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok)
